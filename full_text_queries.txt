Two main ways to search in Elasticsearch:
	1. Queries: retrieve documents that match the specified criteria.
	2. Aggregations: present the summary of your data as metrics, statistics, and other analytics.


Bool queries using boolean combinations of other queries.
Four clauses:
	1. must
	2. must_not
	3. should
	4. filter
	
Build combinations of one or more of these clauses. Clauses are optional and can be mixed and matched. Order of the causes does not matter.

Syntax:

GET name_of_index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {One or more queries can be specified here. A document MUST match all of these queries to be considered as a hit.}
      ],
      "must_not": [
        {A document must NOT match any of the queries specified here. It it does, it is excluded from the search results.}
      ],
      "should": [
        {A document does not have to match any queries specified here. However, it if it does match, this document is given a higher score.}
      ],
      "filter": [
        {These filters(queries) place documents in either yes or no category. Ones that fall into the yes category are included in the hits. }
      ]
    }
  }
}
