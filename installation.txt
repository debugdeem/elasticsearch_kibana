	- Download Elasticsearch from this link.
	- Download Kibana from this link.
	- Move both from downloads to desktop.
	- Extract both .tar.gz files to desktop.
	- Open terminal and CD into extracted Elasticsearch folder.
	- Run bin/elasticsearch
	- STOP!!! COPY AND PASTE THE AUTHENTICATION KEY AND ELASTIC PASSWORD IN A SEPARATE .TXT FILE.
	- Open a new terminal and run:
	- curl --cacert config/certs/http_ca.crt -u elastic https://localhost:9200
		○ Run this if you need to change the password for user [elastic]:
		○ bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic
	- Enter the password and should get a successful ping to the node:
	- Then cd into kibana folder and run bin/kibana
		○ Should show the localhost port and url
		○ Go to that url in a browser
	- To configure elastic you have to have an authentication key which you saved earlier when running bin/elasticsearch
		○ And then the verification key will show up in the kibana terminal
