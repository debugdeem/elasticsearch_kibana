Install Elasticsearch and Kibana locally:
	- Download Elasticsearch from this link.
	- Download Kibana from this link.
	- Move both from downloads to desktop.
	- Extract both .tar.gz files to desktop.
	- Open terminal and CD into extracted Elasticsearch folder.
	- Run bin/elasticsearch
	- STOP!!! COPY AND PASTE THE AUTHENTICATION KEY AND ELASTIC PASSWORD IN A SEPARATE .TXT FILE.
	- Open a new terminal and run:
	- curl --cacert config/certs/http_ca.crt -u elastic https://localhost:9200
		○ Run this if you need to change the password for user [elastic]:
		○ bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic
	- Enter the password and should get a successful ping to the node:
	- Then cd into kibana folder and run bin/kibana
		○ Should show the localhost port and url
		○ Go to that url in a browser
	- To configure elastic you have to have an authentication key which you saved earlier when running bin/elasticsearch
		○ And then the verification key will show up in the kibana terminal
	


How to get health of cluster and nodes :
	- GET _cluster/health
	- GET _nodes/stats

Resolve "Kibana is not ready yet" issue by
	1. commenting out 
		○ xpack.security.enabled: true
		○ xpack.security.enrollment.enabled: true
	- from elasticsearch.yml
	2. make sure 
		○ that network.host: localhost is set in elasticsearch.yml
		○ that "http://localhost:9200" is set in kibana.yml
