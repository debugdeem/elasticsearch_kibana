Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine that allows you to store, search, and analyze your data.

It stores data as documents. Documents with similar traits are grouped into an index.

Coupled with Kibana (a UI designed to visualize and explore data in Elasticsearch), you can design a fantastic search experience for your app users!

When a search query is sent, Elasticsearch retrieves relevant documents and presents the documents as search results.
